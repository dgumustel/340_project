            This website was made for my final project for the UW OCEAN 340 course. My project involved 
            looking at Puget Sound time series data of chlorophyll and oxygen concentrations in surface waters over 
            a period of 60 days. These buttons will download the data files I used and the code I wrote 
            to do my analysis. You can also go to the Northwest Association of Networked Ocean Observing Systems
             (NANOOS) Data Explorer website where I found my data.

        Below is a map of the Puget Sound region that shows the data collection sites. The locations I 
        selected for analysis had consistent sampling during the available 60-day period and offered 
        insight to three different areas of the Pacific Northwest: the Puget Sound Main basin, the North 
        basin, and the Washington coast. Phytoplankton populations are strongly influenced by their 
        environment; factors include residence times, sunlight supply, water column stratification, and nutrient 
        availability. Studying chlorophyll concentrations in different settings can give oceanographers a 
        stronger idea of the relationships between the phytoplankton communities and their environments.

        The first part of my analysis required averaging the time series data into daily values for easy 
        visualization. I plotted the daily averages of chlorophyll and oxygen concentrations individually 
        for each of the four locations, shown here. Many locations were missing data for the start of January 
        which could not be filled by interpolation.

        Next, I wanted to compare trends through time in chlorophyll and oxygen concentrations across locations. 
        Chlorophyll concentrations varied strongly throughout the sampled region, while oxygen concentrations 
        were very similar at each site.

        Finally, I investigated the relationship between chlorophyll, a proxy for phytoplankton populations, 
        and oxygen, a product of photosynthesis. Although phytoplankton are the major producer of oxygen in 
        marine environments, I suspect that the majority of the oxygen in surface waters comes from the exchange of gas
        across the ocean-atmosphere interface. Each location saw a positive correlation between chlorophyll and oxygen concentrations, 
        with r-squared values ranging between 0.00156 in Bellingham and 0.468 in coastal waters. Seasonally heightened
        gas exchange due to heavy wind-driven surface mixing may have weakened the relationship between chlorophyll 
        and oxygen.

        In the future, I would be interested in expanding my time series analysis to include at least a full 
        yearâ€™s worth of chlorophyll data to look further into seasonal variability in phytoplankton populations. 
        The correlation between chlorophyll and oxygen concentrations proved to be small, so my focus might 
        shift from oxygen to other measurable influences on phytoplankton populations. Some options would be water 
        temperature and nearby river discharge, as well as nitrogen or other dissolved nutrient concentrations.

        This work was self-directed and made possible thanks to the guidance and support of my OCEAN 340 instructors 
        and peers. If you'd like to run my python code please download the data files and python code from the download 
        buttons above and place them into the same folder in order for the script to run.
